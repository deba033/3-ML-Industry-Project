# 📊 Machine Learning with KDD Methodology – Multi-Dataset Analysis (3 datasets)

This project applies machine learning techniques to three diverse datasets using the **KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)** process. It covers classification, regression, and time-series analysis—demonstrating how structured methodology can solve real-world problems.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Apply data mining and machine learning techniques using the KDD approach
- **Datasets**:
  1. **Census Income Prediction** – Binary classification
  2. **Air Quality Forecasting** – Regression and time series analysis
  3. **Room Occupancy Estimation** – Sensor-based classification

## ⚙️ Workflow (KDD Process)

1. **Data Selection**
2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handled mixed data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)
   - Performed encoding, normalization, and outlier removal
3. **Transformation**
   - Feature engineering
   - Time-based aggregation
4. **Modeling**
   - Applied classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
   - Applied regression and time series forecasting (for Dataset 2)
5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - RMSE, MAE (for regression)
   - Model comparison across datasets

## 🔍 Dataset Highlights

- **Dataset 1**: Income classification from census data  
  → Focused on encoding categorical data and evaluating classifier performance.

- **Dataset 2**: Air quality regression & forecasting  
  → Applied time-series models and regression for pollutant prediction.

- **Dataset 3**: Room occupancy detection via sensors  
  → Built binary classifiers for environmental sensor data.
